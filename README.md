<h1 align="center">Terminal Commands</h1>

Below commands can be used on any Unix-based operating system, which includes Linux, but also includes Mac OS. If you open up Terminal on your Mac, you can use these exact commands. Windows also has Command Prompt, but some of the commands are slightly different, so it doesn't actually work, because Windows is not a Unix-based system.**

So let's take a look at some of the most often used Linux commands:

| ls  | listing |
| cd `folder name here` | Changes directory e.g. cd `openthisfolder`|
| cd  | Moves to home directory |
| pwd  | Shows the Present Working Directory path |
| . | Current folder |
| .. |  Moves to parent/enclosing directory |
| ./`file name` |  Executes the program |
| cd .. |  Moves back to the parent directory |
